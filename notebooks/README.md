# Monroe County crash data notebooks
*These notebooks describe the cleaning process and basic exploration of the Monroe County crash data. For finalized cleaning scripts, view the [`cleaning-workflow`](../cleaning-workflow) folder, which has more information on how to run the scripts yourself.*

1. Run `Car crash data cleaning.ipynb` first.
2. The `csv` output from the first script will be used in `Standardizing Street Addresses.ipynb`.
